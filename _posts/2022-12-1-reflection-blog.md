# **Final Reflection Blog**

After taking this course, my understanding of digital humanities has completely changed. Coming into this class, I was not completely sure what digital humanities was but I had thought it was just the online version of the humanities discipline such as art or philosophy. I quickly learned that digital humanities is that but also making the humanities more interactive and accessible through the digital medium. While I still do not have a full definition of DH because it can be so many different things I learned so much about the field through the course.

One thing I really enjoyed about this course was the twitter assignment every week. While sometimes it was difficult to do when we had no readings one week, I enjoyed it because it allowed me to reflect on readings, projects, and the class. It gave me a direct way to interact with my classmates who I do not usually interact with while in class. Twitter also allowed me to look at different perspectives regarding the readings and projects we were doing. 

Through the many readings we did I learned a lot about digital humanities, but also about writing. I have always enjoyed writing but through this class I learned a new style of writing, grant writing. In addition to grant writing, I began to understand that there is writing beyond a 5-paragraph academic essay which I am so used to. With that, I became so familiar with writing in short paragraphs that when I went to write papers for other classes I found myself struggling a little bit with going back to writing in what I think of as typical paper writing. 

When beginning the writing process for the blog posts I struggled with understanding how to break up the information into small paragraphs rather than having just a few longer paragraphs. I struggled with this a lot because I am used to writing long paragraphs about one subject in all of my academic classes. I have come to really enjoy writing like this though because it allows so many thoughts to be brought out without feeling repetitive. 

One of the assignments that I enjoyed the most was the blog posts on Github. As a writing intensive I was expecting many papers, however I enjoyed getting to write smaller pieces through a blog medium. Getting to post on the blog and work with the code aspects made me look forward to the writing assignments more because I was able to be creative with how my blog looked through markdown. I struggled at first to understand markdown, but with the help of Dr. Stover and classmates it was easy to pick-up and continue with throughout the semester. 

Regarding the actual content we wrote about in the blog posts, I found myself enjoying doing the DH project reviews. I am a visual and hands-on learner, so being able to interact with different sites helped me to further understand what digital humanities is. Not to mention, doing the review blogs gave me much inspiration when it came to choosing a topic to write my grant about and when we created mock-ups. Additionally, I am also in Introduction to Digital Humanities, so completing these reviews helped me to further my DH understanding and bring different perspectives to my introduction to DH class and projects. 

Overall, this has been one of my favorite classes this semester because it was so different from my other classes. This class was very project based which is something I really enjoyed because it allowed me to be creative and didnâ€™t feel like I had to memorize random facts.
