**Project:** Out of Desert 
**Project Director:** Courtney Sato
**Projet URL:** https://outofthedesert.yale.edu/ 

# Summary:
 
Out of Desert explores the history behind Japanese Internment camps and life inside during World War II. Created by Yale University, they provide many primary sources from those who lived in internment camps. The aim of this project is to educate users about Executive Order 9066 which lead to the internment of over 100,000 individuals.
 
Out of Desert is housed in Yale University’s Library. The project provides background information about Executive Order 9066 through a timeline. The timeline explores the establishment of internment camps, life in the camp, reintegration, and life after internment.
 
# Design:
This site was designed with HTML5 and CSS3 and allows for it to be used in both mobile, tablet, and desktop formats. The site pays special attention to the different types of fonts used throughout. The different fonts try to depict the time period, giving the site a more handwritten feel. Throughout the site there are various maps and graphs that are used to depict different statistics from the time of internment. These maps and graphs were all created using Python programming and put onto the site as an SVG. 
 
# Relevance: 
Out of Desert uses innovative technology to provide users with a way to learn about the rich history surrounding Japanese Internment Camps. The project director’s utilized extensive research from the National Archives to create an interactive map about the camps themselves, and the assembly centers created. In addition to using research from the National Archives, the project director includes a multitude of primary sources including videos, pictures, letters, and artwork. 
 
Additionally, the site offers a way to contact the project team members through a contact form. The site also offers a section, Guest Book, which allows users to leave comments and notes on the page for other consumers of the site to view and potentially respond to. 
 
Finally, the site provides a terms of use regarding the materials used and purpose of Yale University Library where this project is housed. 
 
# Findings:
When you first click onto the site it pops up with directors to explore the map and a button which will lead the reader to find out more information about Executive Order 9066. I think by having the small pop up about directions is helpful to those who may not understand the technology and interactive intentions behind digital humanities sites.

Out of Desert does a great job explaining the history behind Executive Order 9066 and internment to users through interactive slides. It also does well at exploring pictures, videos, letters, and artwork from that time in a user-friendly format and visually appealing. The videos and pictures lack transcripts and subtitles, making them not accessible to readers.
 
On the intiital screen with the map, it is easily accessible for users and when users click on a site it only pops up half screen so they can still see the map area. The interactive map gives the users a more fun way to interact with the different sites and to learn about each individual one and their locations. 
 
In the Design section, it provides extensive information with a picture background. While a good picture, it is not as appealing because of the dark bottom of the background. The dark bottom makes the text difficult to read unless the user is across a significant amount.
 
Additionally, on the Guest Book page, there are light blue fonts indicating what information to put in each box. The color of the font heavily blends in with the background picture and can be difficult for some users to read. It does not make the site as accessible as it could be difficult to read for those who are colorblind.

When the webpage is minimized to half screen, the header gets mixed up with each other. An improvement would be changing the settings in the CSS to make ensure the header moves at each size of the site.
 
# Credit:
The website lacks an acknowledgments section, which does not give the creators correct credit for their work. When trying to find the project director it took an additional Google search to find that information. By adding a credits section it would allow the reader to find out more information about the creators, but also give the creators credit for their hard work. There is a tab at the bottom of the site called NPS which provides information about where the creators got much of their research from. It explains the grant given by the U.S. Department of Interior, National Park Service and includes information about how to contact them.
