# Summary:
_Artists in Paris_ is a mapping project of artists in Paris during the late 17th century into the 18th century. Paris is home to many renowned artistic communities, especially during the early centuries, therefore this project provides information about these communities during the 18th century. 
Due to the difficulty of finding information from so long ago, this project highlights artists who were all members of the French Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. 

# Credit:
_Artists in Paris_ was funded by the Leverhulme Trust Early Career Research Fellowship which was awarded to the project crater Hannah Williams through Queen Mary University of London. Queen Mary University of London provided additional support in research for the project which was funded by a grant from the University of Oxford’s John Fell Fund.

# Design:
This site was designed using OpenLayers, a dynamic mapping creation site. Also utilizing Bootstrap, an open-source CSS and HTML program. The historical maps were created using Map Warper which is an open-source map warper. 

# Relevance:
_Artists in Paris_ created a way for people interested in Parisian and French art throughout the 18th century to quickly find out information about the artists living there during that time. The information in the project allows people to explore the rich history of artistry in Paris and traces it all the way back to the 18th century. The map contains a sidebar about each artists and includes brief information such as where the artists lived, what type of art they specialized in, and a picture of them (if applicable). 
When looking for information about each artist, the website provides brief information about each one, including what they specialized in, where they lived, and a picture if applicable. 

# Findings:
When you first open up the web page a pop-up screen appears which provides users with information about the creators and premise of the website, an open-access digital art history project. I like how the pop-up has an option at the bottom for the user to click “Don’t Show This Again” because if users are frequenting the site, the pop-up could get annoying to see and click off every time.

When looking into the artists included in this map, I think it would have been beneficial to include more artists instead of just ones who attended the French Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. If they solely chose to include those artists and did not want to find others, the project could be renamed to fit that description instead of just calling it Artists in Paris and generalizing it to all artists.  
When doing the initial reading into the site and how it is an open-access site, where users can add to the map, I was worried about how that could work with making sure all the information was accurate. However, after further investigation, the spot where users can add addresses and information in themselves to aid them in their own research, therefore it is not made public. This is done through having each users map view have a unique, shareable URL address that loads the map area, addresses, and popups selected. The site can be completely customizable to each user.

# Own Project:
In regard to my own project, I chose Artists in Paris, because of the mapping project feature and how it will relate to mine. Since I will be creating a map about the victims of Ted Bundy and want to include information about each victim, the way the creators incorporated information about the artists is similar to my vision. Additionally, within my project, I am looking to add additional tabs of data including information about Bundy himself, the trial, and further information about why this project is essential. The additional tabs on the Artists in Paris such as “About” or “Guide” show how I want to represent the tabs on my site with further information.
