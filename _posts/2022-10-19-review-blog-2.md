# Summary:
_Artists in Paris_ is a mapping project of artists in Paris during the late 17th century into the 18th century. Paris is home to many renowned artistic communities, therefore this project provides information about those communities during this time period. Due to the difficulty of finding information from so long ago, this project highlights artists who were all members of the French Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. The site is designed to give users an interactive way to learn and research about art during the mid to late 1600s to 1700s.

# Credit:
_Artists in Paris_ was funded by the Leverhulme Trust Early Career Research Fellowship which was awarded to the project creator Hannah Williams and Chris Sparks through Queen Mary University of London. Queen Mary University of London provided additional support in research for the project which was funded by a grant from the University of Oxford’s John Fell Fund.

# Design:
This site was designed using OpenLayers, a dynamic mapping creation site. Also utilizing Bootstrap, an open-source CSS and HTML program. The historical maps were created using Map Warper which is an open-source map warper. The map warper takes the historical map and adjusts and stretches it to fit on the real, currently world map coordinates. In this project’s case, it took maps from early Paris and put them on-top of current-world maps for viewers to compare them too. 


# Relevance:
_Artists in Paris_ created a way for people interested in Parisian and French art throughout the 18th century to quickly find out information about the artists living there during that time. The information in the project allows people to explore the rich history of artistry in Paris and traces it all the way back to the late 17th and 18th centuries. The map contains a sidebar about each artist and includes brief information such as where the artists lived, what type of art they specialized in, and a picture of them (if applicable). 


# Findings:
When the user first open up the web page a pop-up screen appears which provides users with information about the creators and premise of the website, an open-access digital art history project. I like how the pop-up has an option at the bottom for the user to click “Don’t Show This Again” because if users are frequenting the site, the pop-up could get annoying to see and click off every time.

When looking into the artists included in this map, I think it would have been beneficial to include more artists instead of just ones who attended the French Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. If they solely chose to include those artists and did not want to find others, the project could be renamed to fit that description instead of just calling it _Artists in Paris_ and generalizing it to all artists. 

Furthermore, there is a function on the site where the user can search artists through the year, artists, and personally entered data. When clicking on searching by artist, only one artist comes up, and to begin to find others, the user then has to search their name in the search bar. This feature makes it difficult for users like myself with no prior knowledge of artistry in Paris, to navigate through the site. To change this feature it would be helpful to have a scrolling list of the artists included in the site, and a search bar option for users.

When doing the initial reading into the site and how it is an open-access site, where users can add to the map, I was worried about how that could work with making sure all the information was accurate. However, after further investigation, the spot where users can add addresses and information in themselves to aid them in their own research, therefore it is not made public. This is done through having each user's map view have a unique, shareable URL address that loads the map area, addresses, and popups selected. The site can be completely customizable to each user.

On the right side scroll bar, there is a “Guide” section which provides a little bit more background information on what _Artists In Paris_ is and how to navigate the website. The directions about navigating and how to include your own data in the site provides a good way for users to fully understand how to navigate the site. This section of the site is very text heavy, therefore some pictures or videos demonstrating how to navigate it oculd be helpful to help break up the long sections of text.

The overall site has plenty of features that allow users to customize their overall website experience. Under the “Settings” tab on the bottom, users have the option to customize how the map looks, icons, and colors to use. The user can also customize what features that they want to see on the map at once- such as only seeing the icons of artists, the data entered by the user, Art World Sites (such as the Louvre), and various types of maps that the site offers to choose from. This allows for users to have complete creative control over their experience interacting with the website.

# Own Project:
In regard to my own project, I chose Artists in Paris, because of the mapping project feature and how it will relate to mine. Since I will be creating a map about the victims of Ted Bundy and want to include information about each victim, the way the creators incorporated information about the artists is similar to my vision. Additionally, within my project, I am looking to add additional tabs of data including information about Bundy himself, the trial, and further information about why this project is essential. The additional tabs on the Artists in Paris such as “About” or “Guide” show how I want to represent the tabs on my site with further information. Though this project goes much more indepth with the creativity than I plan to do with my project, I think that it is a good starting point to help me see different types of interactive maps and how to make my project better and more enjoyable to users.
