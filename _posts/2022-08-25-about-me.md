#### My name is Kelsey (she/her) and I am from Richmond, VA. I am currently a junior, double majoring in Communication and Leadership with a minor in Digitial Humanities at Christopher Newport University.

I decided to major in Communication and Leadership because I am really interested in how relationships develop and work, but also the media side of communication. I have a split track of the media and interpersonal side of communication and I think being a leadership major helps with the interpersonal side, while eh DH minor gears toward the media side. As I will discuss later on, my future career goals are just as split with it. I think being involved in both allows me to have a diverse experience in the comm major and understand both sides can be very well-rounding for any future career. 

While choosing the DH minor I was honestly _really_ unsure of what it was, but I thought it might pair well with my major. Now that I am involved in it, I am super excited about all the possibilities that come with this area of study. I am in specifically Writing for the Digital Humanities because it fulfills a writing intensive requirement, but also because of the great skills you can learn in this class like coding on Github, grant writing, and overall usage of digital technology in the humanities. Aside from taking this English class, I am also in an intro digital humanities course this semester.

Outside of academics, I keep myself **extremely busy**. I am involved in Greek life as a sister of [Phi Mu](https://phimu.org/), I serve as a Resident Assistant on North Campus, have an additional on-campus role as a front desk worker in the Student Affairs Office, I am a part of the Presidents Leadership Program, and play club field hockey. Like I said, I keep myself super busy.

Aside from my on-campus involvements, I have worked for a Homeowners Association for the past two summers as an intern in the office. It was an interesting experience, to say the least, but it was also a rewarding one. It somewhat reminds me of working in the Student Affairs office as I deal with angry residents, but also the sweetest residents. 

After graduating from CNU with my bachelor's degree, there are two _very_ different tracks that I am considering. I either want to pursue a career working for the government in a communications department, but I donâ€™t know specifically what. 

If not working for the government, I want to get my masters in Higher Education and pursue a career in Higher Education Student Affairs. Because of my jobs on campus, I have been heavily exposed to the student affairs department in higher education, and while the jobs are demanding I find them to be so rewarding being able to work one on one with the students. 

While my options are quite different from each other I think that also allows me a lot of different options and opportunities to pursue different things. Yet, it is also extremely stressful when trying to decide which path I eventually want to find myself down. You will certainly find me at the career fairs this semester while trying to figure out what path is the best fit for me.

This past summer I had the opportunity to study abroad in Europe through a leadership course with CNU.  We spent the majority of our time in the Netherlands but had the opportunity to travel to 5 other countries on a day or few day trips. Having never been out of the country it was an amazing experience and **I definitely recommend traveling abroad to anyone!** I learned so much about other cultures and about myself through this experience!!
